			<p>Hi there! I am a researcher working on algorithms for learning from data, without invading the privacy of individuals in the data set. I also study fairness and systematic bias in learning algorithms. I love taking a multi-disciplinary approach to understanding problems, especially viewing them through mathematical, economic, legal, and ethical lenses. </p>

<!-- 			<p> I enjoy engaging conversations and long walks. Better if both are together! I am heavily influenced by the writings of Professor <a href="https://web.media.mit.edu/~minsky/" target="_blank"> Marvin Minsky</a> and lyricist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sirivennela_Seetharama_Sastry" target="_blank"> Sirivennela Seetharama Sastry</a>.</p>

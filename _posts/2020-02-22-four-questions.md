<h2>The four questions</h2>

I spent a lot of time in the past one year thinking about what I should be looking for in a job. I settled on the below four questions to evaluate a job.

1) Who am I working with?

2) Who am I reporting to?

3) What am I being paid for?

4) Where is the money coming from?

*What I look for as answers to these questions might change over time but the questions shall remain same.*

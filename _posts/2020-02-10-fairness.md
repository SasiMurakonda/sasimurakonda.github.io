<h2>On fairness and systematic bias....</h2>

<!-- How do we study fairness in learning algorithms?
 -->
Is group fairness fair to individuals?

Does justice apply to groups?

Is historical evidence of systematic bias against a group enough to forgo justice to individuals in favor of justice for groups (if there exist something as such)?

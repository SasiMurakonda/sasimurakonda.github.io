Below are a few things that I *choose* to strongly believe in.....

1) <a href= "https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html" target = "_blank">The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not. </a>

2) The most important thing about a problem is not its solution but the strength we gain in finding the solution.

3) <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/1004497-we-cannot-change-anything-unless-we-accept-it-condemnation-does" target = "_blank">We cannot change anything unless we accept it. Condemnation doesn't liberate, it oppresses. </a>

4) Do not noun people. Verb them. (You are not a liar. You lied. You are not a bad person. You did something bad.)

Hope clouds observation.

Grief and resilience live together.

Puppet is free as long as he loves his strings.

To accept a little death is worse than death itself.

You can choose what you do; you can’t choose what you like to do.

If the unexamined life was not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?

Learn to not approach anything as a game to win, except, of course, if it is a game.

Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.

Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them.

Respect for the truth comes close to being the basis for all morality. Something cannot emerge from nothing. This is profound thinking if you understand how unstable “the truth” can be.

Much of our life is conducted online, which is another way of saying that much of our life is conducted under rules set by large private businesses, which are subject neither to much regulation nor much real market competition.

Tell me of thine eyes And I will tell thee of thy heart. Tell me of thy feet And I will tell thee of thy hands. Tell me of thy sleeping And I will tell thee of thy waking. Tell me of thy desires And I will tell thee of thy need.

Because the brain mediates our experience of the world, any neurosurgical problem forces a patient and family, ideally with a doctor as a guide, to answer this question: What makes life meaningful enough to go on living?

“Satisficing” (the melding together of satisfy and suffice): You stop when you get a near-satisfactory solution. Otherwise it may take you an eternity to reach the smallest conclusion or perform the smallest act. We are therefore rational, but in a limited way: “boundedly rational.”

There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry, elegance, and grace— those qualities you find always in that which the true artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society, seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward death.

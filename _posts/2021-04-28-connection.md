<h2>What is the connection?</h2>

Some thoughts after reading <a href= "https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty" target = "_blank">this great review</a> of the book progress and poverty....
 
1. Are there parallels between the concepts of land and human attention, other than the fact that they are both limited?

2. Isn't Facebook and Google's advertising revenue "rent" for our attention? 

> Rent, in short, is the price of monopoly, arising from the reduction to individual ownership of natural elements which human exertion can neither produce nor increase.

<!-- > Differences in civilization are not due to differences in individuals, but rather to differences in social organization; progress, always kindled by association, always passes to retrogression as inequality is developed. -->

3. How will the problem of inequality manifest with the upcoming technological forces?

>The new forces, elevating in their nature though they be, do not act upon the social fabric from underneath,..., but strike it at a point intermediate between top and bottom. It is as though an immense wedge were being forced, not underneath society, but through society. Those who are above the point of separation are elevated, but those who are below are crushed down.

4. If speculation on land price leads to economic depressions, will we see the next depression due to speculation on price of our attention?

<h2>What is the connection?</h2>

Some thoughts after reading <a href= "https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progress-and-poverty" target = "_blank">this great review</a> of the book progress and poverty....
 
1) Are there parallels between the concepts of land and human attention, other than the fact that they are both limited?

2) Isn't Facebook and Google's advertising revenue "rent" for our attention? 

3) How will the problem of inequality manifest with the upcoming technological forces?

4) If speculation on land price leads to economic depressions, will we see the next depression due to speculation on price of our attention?

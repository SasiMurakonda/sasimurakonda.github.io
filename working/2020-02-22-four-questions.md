<h2>The four questions</h2>

I spent a lot of time in the past one year thinking about what I should be looking for in a job. I settled on the below four questions to evaluate a job. What do you think?

1) Who am I working with?

It is important that we understand who we are spend most of our waking hours for a large part of the week. What should I be looking for in colleagues?

Ability to learn from them? Like mindedness? Similar attitude

2) Who am I reporting to?

3) What am I being paid for?

4) Where is the money coming from?



*What I look for as answers to these questions might change over time but the questions shall remain same.*
